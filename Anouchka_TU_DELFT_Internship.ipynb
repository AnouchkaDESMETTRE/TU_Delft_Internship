Lahaye (DIAM - EEMCS Faculty - TU Delft)\n\n# Title: Mathematical modelling and numerical simulation of driving buses and vibrations door   \n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe sustainable growth of cities increasingly relies on public transportation, prompting major bus manufacturers such as Volvo, VDL, and Scania to explore innovative vehicle models and systems. Among these systems, bus door mechanisms play a crucial role, requiring continual refinement and optimization. \n\nIn this context, numerical modeling emerges as a pivotal tool to support and enhance the design and construction of bus doors. This approach allows for detailed analysis and simulation of various door configurations, materials, and operational scenarios, facilitating informed decision-making throughout the development process.\n\nOur collaboration with Ventura, a renowned leader in bus door manufacturing, provides valuable insights into the industry's demands and challenges. Ventura's commitment to cutting-edge technology and rigorous safety standards underscores the importance of advanced modeling techniques in addressing complex engineering requirements.\n\n### 1.1 Test Scenarios\n\n  \n\nImpact study: study of impact of object falling on elastic structure. Example sandbag test falling on door system (door leaves plus door support mechanism). \n\n\n\nForced vibration study: study of impact of forced vibration on elastic structure. Example door system mounted on shaker table or on bus driving over test track. \n\n\n\n## 2/ Definitions of Terms \n\n**Plug Sliding Door**:\n   - *Definition*: A type of sliding door mechanism commonly used in transportation vehicles such as buses and trains. The plug sliding door system typically consists of two door leaves that slide horizontally along a track, allowing for efficient ingress and egress of passengers. The term \"plug\" refers to the door leaf's ability to tightly seal against the door frame when closed, providing enhanced safety and protection against external elements.\n\n**Bus Door Leaf**:\n   - *Definition*: The individual panel or leaf that constitutes a bus door. Bus door leaves are typically constructed from lightweight yet durable materials such as aluminum or composite alloys. They serve as the primary barrier between the interior and exterior of the bus, facilitating passenger entry and exit while providing structural integrity and security.\n\n**Bus Door Suspension Mechanism**:\n   - *Definition*: The mechanical system responsible for supporting and facilitating the movement of bus door leaves. The suspension mechanism typically consists of a network of hinges, rollers, and guides that enable smooth operation of the doors while ensuring proper alignment and stability. This system may include pneumatic, hydraulic, or electromechanical components to assist in opening and closing the doors.\n\n**Upper Door Arm**:\n   - *Definition*: A structural component of the bus door suspension mechanism located at the top of the door frame. The upper door arm serves as a pivotal attachment point for the door leaf, allowing it to pivot outward or inward during the opening and closing process. It provides stability and support while guiding the movement of the door leaf along its designated trajectory.\n\n**Bottom Door Support**:\n   - *Definition*: The lowermost element of the bus door suspension mechanism, situated at the base of the door frame. The bottom door support serves as a foundation for the door leaf, preventing excessive movement or misalignment during operation. It may consist of rollers, tracks, or other guiding elements designed to ensure smooth and controlled movement of the door leaf along its intended path.\n\n\n## 3/ Single Point Mass System \n\n\n\n### 3.1 Case-study/Description/Motion\n\nThis section aims to create models using mass-spring-damper systems to simulate the vibrations of bus doors while the bus is in motion. We'll consider the entire single door (door leaf and door frame) as a single point mass with negligible physical dimensions.\n\n\n### 3.2/ Mathematical Model \n\n\n\nODE for mass-spring-damper + initial conditions for position and velocity (1-DOF along x-axis) \n\n\n\nm \\ddot{u}(t) + \\gamma \\dot{u}(t) + k u(t) = F_{external}(t)\n\n\n\nzero initial position and velocity \n\n\n\n### 3.3/ Parameter values \n\n\n\nm: between 50 and 100 kg \n\nk: such that \\sqrt{k/m} matches with measure resonant frequency \n\n\\gamma: hard to estimate - resort to \n\n\n\n### 3.4/ Impact study \n\n\n\ntest case description: impulsive force on mass-spring-damper (1-DOF along x-axis) system \n\n\n\nF_external: either a Dirac delta or a Gaussian pulse: perform FFT on Gaussian pulse to verify whether exitation contains a contribution in resonant frequency  \n\n\n\nanalytical solution in case of no damping (\\gamma = 0) assuming Dirac delta as excitation: Laplace transform: U(s) = constant/[ m s^2 + k]. Inverse Laplace transform. u(t) =  [ F_0/m sin(w_0 t) ] u(t=t_0). Physical interpretation: undamped harmonic oscillation at eigenfrequency (resonant frequency) of the system starting at the time of impact. Damped oscillation in case that \\gamma <> 0.  \n\n\n\nanalytical solution in case of damping (\\gamma <> 0): repeat above procedure. Obtain damped oscillation starting at the time of impact.\n\n\n\nnumerical study: numerical integration using DifferentialEquations.jl (implicit and explicit method, various absolute and relative tolerances, compare with the analytical solution, plot log10 of absolute value of the error). Analyze frequency orbit using Fast Fourier transform; \n\n\n\n### 3.5/ Vibration study \n\n\n\ntest case description: forced vibration of mass-spring-damper system at driving frequency \\omega_d. \n\n\n\nF_external: F_0 \\sin(\\omega_d t)\n\n\n\nanalytical solution: Laplace transform and its inverse. Superposition of two harmonic oscillations. First at eigenfrequency (resonant frequency) of the system. Second at driving frequency. Harmonic solution is damped oscillation in case that \\gamma <> 0. Only harmonic solution at driving frequency remains for large time (steady state). \n\n\n\nAnalytical solution: Laplace transform or method of undetermined coefficients. Study frequency response (\\omega_d < \\omega_0, \\omega_d = \\omega_0 and \\omega_d > \\omega_0)\n\n\n\nnumerical study:  as before; \n\n\n\n## 4/ Two Point Mass System \n\n\n\n### 4.1/ Case-study/Description/Motion: \n\n\n\nConsider model with two interconnected point masses (2-DOF along x-axis) (bus and door, two doors, door separated into two parts, door seperated into glass and metal frame). \n\n\n\n### 4.2/ Mathematical Model \n\n\n\nSystem of two coupled ODE \n\n\n\n### 4.3/ Impact study \n\n\nImpose impact on one of two point masses. Solve analytically using Laplace transform (find linear system for U_1(s) and U_2(s), solve linear system, perform backtransform to obtain u_1(t) and u_2(t)). Solve analytically using matrix diagonalization. Two resonant frequencies. Two vibrational eigenmodes (see comsol.com webpage). Solve numerically using time integration. Compare analytical and numerical solution. \n \n### 4.4/ Vibration study \n\n\nImpose forced vibration with driving frequency \\omega_d on one of two point masses. Proceed as before.  Investigate frequency response, in particular \\omega_d close to one of both resonant frequencies. \n\n\n\nReferences: \n\nhttps://github.com/ziolai/ventura-modeling/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/point-mass-systems.ipynb \n\n\n\n## 5/ Stationary Thin Beam Equation - Biharmonic Equation - Deflection \n\n\n\nFind analytical reference solution on wiki pages.

Solve bi-harmonic equation using finite element method on non-uniform spatial mesh. \n\n\n\nReferences: \n\nimplementation in part available; \n\n\n\n## 6/ Thin Beam Equation Modal Analysis \n\n\n\nFind analytical expressions for the eigenmodes. Recover analytical expression by computing eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the discrete bi-harmonic equation. \n\n\n\nThe eigenvectors of the matrix A are numerical approximation to the shape modes or modal modes of the structure. These modes are explained on the wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_analysis_using_FEM . This webpage says that \"The physical interpretation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors which come from solving the system are that they represent the frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. Sometimes, the only desired modes are the lowest frequencies because they can be the most prominent modes at which the object will vibrate, dominating all the higher frequency modes.‚Äù\n\n\n\n## 7/ Thin Beam Equation Transient Analysis \n\n\n\nFind analytical reference solution (using e.g,. separation of variables) in literature. \n\n\n\nRecover analytical reference solution using finite difference in space and time-integration iin time domain. \n\n\n\n(In case that Anouchka finds this interesting and fun): replace uniform mesh finite differences in space by non-uniform mesh finite elements in space. \n\n\n\nReferences: \n\n\\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler\\%E2\\%80\\%93Bernoulli_beam_theory}\n\n\n\n## 8/ Thin Beam Equation Transient Analysis with Hinges as Boundary conditions \n\n\n\nFind reference solutions (see e.g. papers by Demeio - Lenci - 2019) (need to give Anouchka access to paper). \n\n\n\nReproduce reference results numerically using either finite differences on uniform mesh first and possibly using finite elements on non-uniform mesh later. \n\n\n\n## 9/ Extend to Two Dimensional Kirchoff - Love Thin Plate Equations \n\n[In case time, enthousiasm and excitement remains] \n\nReferences\n\n\\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff\\%E2\\%80\\%93Love\\_plate\\_theory}\n\n\n\n## 10/ Conclusions \n\n\n\nWhat we learned in the project. \n",
