Lahaye (DIAM - EEMCS Faculty - TU Delft)\n\n# Title: Mathematical modelling and numerical simulation of driving buses and vibrations door   \n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe sustainable growth of cities increasingly relies on public transportation, prompting major bus manufacturers such as Volvo, VDL, and Scania to explore innovative vehicle models and systems. Among these systems, bus door mechanisms play a crucial role, requiring continual refinement and optimization. \n\nIn this context, numerical modeling emerges as a pivotal tool to support and enhance the design and construction of bus doors. This approach allows for detailed analysis and simulation of various door configurations, materials, and operational scenarios, facilitating informed decision-making throughout the development process.\n\nOur collaboration with Ventura, a renowned leader in bus door manufacturing, provides valuable insights into the industry's demands and challenges. Ventura's commitment to cutting-edge technology and rigorous safety standards underscores the importance of advanced modeling techniques in addressing complex engineering requirements.\n\n### 1.1 Test Scenarios\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nImpact study: study of impact of object falling on elastic structure. Example sandbag test falling on door system (door leaves plus door support mechanism). \n\nForced vibration study: study of impact of forced vibration on elastic structure. Example door system mounted on shaker table or on bus driving over test track. \n\n\n\n## 2/ Definitions of Terms \n\n**Plug Sliding Door**:\n   - *Definition*: A type of sliding door mechanism commonly used in transportation vehicles such as buses and trains. The plug sliding door system typically consists of two door leaves that slide horizontally along a track, allowing for efficient ingress and egress of passengers. The term \"plug\" refers to the door leaf's ability to tightly seal against the door frame when closed, providing enhanced safety and protection against external elements.\n\n**Bus Door Leaf**:\n   - *Definition*: The individual panel or leaf that constitutes a bus door. Bus door leaves are typically constructed from lightweight yet durable materials such as aluminum or composite alloys. They serve as the primary barrier between the interior and exterior of the bus, facilitating passenger entry and exit while providing structural integrity and security.\n\n**Bus Door Suspension Mechanism**:\n   - *Definition*: The mechanical system responsible for supporting and facilitating the movement of bus door leaves. The suspension mechanism typically consists of a network of hinges, rollers, and guides that enable smooth operation of the doors while ensuring proper alignment and stability. This system may include pneumatic, hydraulic, or electromechanical components to assist in opening and closing the doors.\n\n**Upper Door Arm**:\n   - *Definition*: A structural component of the bus door suspension mechanism located at the top of the door frame. The upper door arm serves as a pivotal attachment point for the door leaf, allowing it to pivot outward or inward during the opening and closing process. It provides stability and support while guiding the movement of the door leaf along its designated trajectory.\n\n**Bottom Door Support**:\n   - *Definition*: The lowermost element of the bus door suspension mechanism, situated at the base of the door frame. The bottom door support serves as a foundation for the door leaf, preventing excessive movement or misalignment during operation. It may consist of rollers, tracks, or other guiding elements designed to ensure smooth and controlled movement of the door leaf along its intended path.\n\n\n## 3/ Single Point Mass System \n\n\n### 3.1 Case-study/Description/Motion\n\nThis section aims to create models using mass-spring-damper systems to simulate the vibrations of bus doors while the bus is in motion. We'll consider the entire single door (door leaf and door frame) as a single point mass with negligible physical dimensions.\nThe spring represents the elastic forces that tend to return the door to its equilibrium position after a disturbance. The stiffer the spring, the higher the spring constant $k$. The damper represents the frictional or resistive forces that dissipate the energy of the oscillations. Higher damping coefficient $γ$ means the oscillations are attenuated more quickly.\n\n\n### 3.2/ Mathematical Model \n\n#### ODE for Mass-Spring-Damper System\n\nConsider a mass-spring-damper system with the following equation of motion:\n$ \nm \\ddot{u}(t) + \\gamma \\dot{u}(t) + k u(t) = F_{external}(t)\n$\n\nwhere:\n- $ m $ is the mass\n- $ \\gamma $ is the damping coefficient\n- $ k $ is the spring constant\n- $ u(t) $is the displacement as a function of time\n- $ \\dot{u}(t)$ is the velocity\n- $ \\ddot{u}(t)$ is the acceleration\n- $ F_{external}(t)$ is the external force applied to the system\n  \n#### Initial Conditions\n\nThe system starts from rest, so the initial conditions are:\n\n$\nu(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{(zero initial position)}\n$\n\n$\n\\dot{u}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{(zero initial velocity)}\n$\n\n#### Analytical Solution\n\n1. **Homogeneous Solution:**\n\n   First, we solve the homogeneous equation (without the external force):\n   $ m \\ddot{u}(t) + \\gamma \\dot{u}(t) + k u(t) = 0 $\n\n   This is a standard second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is: $ m r^2 + \\gamma r + k = 0 $\n\n   Solving for $ r $:\n   $ r = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2m} $\n\n   The nature of the solution $ r $ depends on the discriminant $ \\Delta = \\gamma^2 - 4mk $:\n\n   - **Overdamped** ($ \\Delta > 0 $): Two distinct real roots.\n   - **Critically damped** ($ \\Delta = 0 $): One real root (repeated).\n   - **Underdamped** ($ \\Delta < 0 $): Two complex conjugate roots.\n     \nIn the case of bus doors, a slightly underdamped system allows for quick and efficient opening and closing, ensuring passenger safety and comfort. This design strikes a balance between speed and stability, minimizing oscillations and reducing wear on mechanical components, thereby enhancing the overall durability and performance of the door mechanism. So : \n   $ r = \\alpha \\pm i\\beta $\n   where $ \\alpha = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2m} $ and $ \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{4mk - \\gamma^2}}{2m} $.\n\n   The general solution to the homogeneous equation is: $ u_h(t) = e^{\\alpha t} (C_1 \\cos(\\beta t) + C_2 \\sin(\\beta t)) $\n\n2. **Particular Solution:**\n\n To find the particular solution $u_p(t)$, we will consider that $F_{external}$ is either a Dirac delta or a Gaussian pulse:\n\n**Dirac Delta Function** :\n$F_{\\text{external}}(t) = F_0 \\delta(t - t_0)$ \n\nFor $u(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{u}(0) = \\frac{F_0}{m}$:\n       - At $t = 0$, $u(0) = 0$ gives $C_1 = 0$.\n       - The derivative of $u_h(t)$ at $t = 0$ is $\\dot{u}(0) = \\alpha C_1 + \\beta C_2 = \\frac{F_0}{m}$. Since $C_1 = 0$, we have:\n     $\\beta C_2 = \\frac{F_0}{m} \\implies C_2 = \\frac{F_0}{m\\beta}$\n\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ into the general solution, we get:\n   $h(t) = \\frac{1}{m\\beta} e^{\\alpha t} \\sin(\\beta t) \\, u(t)$\n   where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function.\n   \nThe total solution $u_{pD}(t)$ for any external force $F_{\\text{external}}(t)$ is obtained by convolving $F_{\\text{external}}(t)$ with the impulse response $h(t)$, so:\n\n$u_{pD}(t) = (h * F_{\\text{external}})(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(t - \\tau) F_{\\text{external}}(\\tau) \\, d\\tau$\n\n**Gaussian Pulse** :\n$F_{\\text{external}}(t) = F_0 e^{-\\frac{(t - t_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$\n   \nFor $u(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{u}(0) = \\frac{F_0}{m}$:\n   - At $t = 0$, $u(0) = 0$ gives $C_1 = 0$.\n   - The derivative of $u_h(t)$ at $t = 0$ is $\\dot{u}(0) = \\alpha C_1 + \\beta C_2 = \\frac{F_0}{m}$. Since $C_1 = 0$, we have:\n     $\\beta C_2 = \\frac{F_0}{m} \\implies C_2 = \\frac{F_0}{m\\beta}$\n\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ into the general solution, we obtain:\n   $h(t) = \\frac{1}{m\\beta} e^{\\alpha t} \\sin(\\beta t) \\, u(t)$\n   where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function.\n\nThe total solution $u_{pG}(t)$ for any external force $F_{\\text{external}}(t)$ is obtained by convolving $F_{\\text{external}}(t)$ with the impulse response $h(t)$:\n\n$u_{pG}(t) = (h * F_{\\text{external}})(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(t - \\tau) F_{\\text{external}}(\\tau) \\, d\\tau$\n\n3. **General Solution:**\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n\n$ u(t) = u_h(t) + u_p(t) $\n\n\n### 3.3/ Parameter values \n\n1. **Mass $m$:**\n   Between 50 and 100 kg.\n\n3. **Spring Constant $k$:**\n   Such that $\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$ matches the measured resonant frequency $\\omega_0$, meaning that : $ k = m\\omega_0^2$ (simple harmonic motion) \n\n4. **Damping Coefficient $\\gamma$:**\n   Hard to estimate directly. Resort to experimental measurements or tuning based on observations.\n\n\n### 3.4/ Impact study \n\n#### Test Case Description \n\nIn this test case, we will study the response of a mass-spring-damper system subjected to an impulsive force. The system is one-dimensional, with motion along the x-axis.\n\n#### Frequency Analysis\n- As said before, the external force can be either a Dirac delta function or a Gaussian pulse.\n- To analyze the frequency content of the excitation, we will perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the Gaussian pulse to verify if it contains a contribution at the system's resonant frequency.",

Inverse Laplace Transform:\n\n   To find $u(t)$, we take the inverse Laplace transform of $U(s)$:\n   $\n   U(s) = \\frac{F_0 e^{-s t_0}}{m s^2 + k}\n   $\n\n   Recognizing that $m s^2 + k = m (s^2 + \\omega_0^2)$ where $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$, the expression becomes:\n   $\n   U(s) = \\frac{F_0 e^{-s t_0}}{m (s^2 + \\omega_0^2)}\n   $\n\n   Using the inverse Laplace transform for $\\frac{1}{s^2 + \\omega_0^2}$, thanks to standard Laplace transform tables, we get:\n   $\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{e^{-s t_0}}{s^2 + \\omega_0^2}\\right\\} = \\sin(\\omega_0 (t - t_0)) u(t - t_0)\n   $\n\n   Therefore:\n   $\n   u(t) = \\frac{F_0}{m \\omega_0} \\sin(\\omega_0 (t - t_0)) u(t - t_0)\n   $\n\n5. Physical Interpretation:\n\n   This represents an undamped harmonic oscillation at the resonant frequency of the system:\n   $\n   u(t) = \\frac{F_0}{m \\omega_0} \\sin(\\omega_0 (t - t_0)) u(t - t_0)\n   $.\n\n   Physically, when an impulsive force $F_0$ is applied at time $t_0$, the system starts oscillating with a sinusoidal motion, represented by the term $\\sin(\\omega_0 (t - t_0))$. The amplitude of the oscillation is determined by the ratio $\\frac{F_0}{m \\omega_0}$, which depends on the magnitude of the applied force, the mass of the system, and the resonant frequency. The Heaviside function, $u(t - t_0)$, ensures that the motion only starts after the impulsive force is applied. It is 0 for $t < t_0$ and 1 for $t \\geq t_0$. Since there is no damping, the oscillations will continue indefinitely without decreasing in amplitude.\n\n\n**Analytical solution in case of damping:**\n\nHere, $\\gamma \\neq 0$ assuming Dirac delta as excitation:\n\n1. Laplace Transform:\n   \n   The equation of motion for a mass-spring-damper system and a Dirac delta function as the excitation is:\n   $\n   m \\ddot{u}(t) + \\gamma \\dot{u}(t) + k u(t) =  F_0 \\delta(t - t_0)\n   $\n\n   Taking the Laplace transform of both sides:\n   $\n   m s^2 U(s) + \\gamma s U(s) + k U(s) = F_0 e^{-s t_0}\n   $\n\n   Solving for $U(s)$:\n   $\n   U(s) = \\frac{F_0 e^{-s t_0}}{m s^2 + \\gamma s + k}\n   $\n\n3.

Physical Interpretation:\n   \n   This represents a damped oscillation starting at the time of impact $t_0$:\n   $\n   u(t) = \\frac{F_0}{m \\beta} e^{-\\alpha (t - t_0)} \\sin(\\beta (t - t_0)) u(t - t_0)\n   $\n\n   Here the amplitude of the oscillation will decrease over time due to the damping effect in the term $e^{-\\alpha (t - t_0)}$.\n   The system oscillates at a reduced frequency $\\beta$ which is less than $\\omega_0$. So the oscillations decay and eventually stop.\n\n\n#### Numerical study\nBelow are the steps of the numerical study:\n\n1. **Numerical Integration:**\n   - **DifferentialEquations.jl:**\n     The Julia library `DifferentialEquations.jl` has been used to numerically solve the differential equations of the mass-spring-damper system.\n   - **Implicit and Explicit Methods:**\n     Integration methods can be implicit or explicit. Explicit methods calculate the future state of a system directly from the current state, while implicit methods may require solving a system of simultaneous equations at each time step.\n   - **Absolute and Relative Tolerances:**\n     In numerical integration, it is important to control the error of the solution. Absolute and relative tolerances are parameters that define the precision of the solution. Absolute tolerance sets a limit on the absolute error of the solution, while relative tolerance sets a limit on the error relative to the magnitude of the solution.\n\n2. **Comparison with the Analytical Solution:**\n   - Compare the results of the numerical integration with the analytical solution to verify the accuracy and validity of the numerical model.\n\n3. **Error evolution display**\n   - Calculate the absolute error between the numerical solution and the analytical solution and plot its logarithm (base 10). This allows visualizing the order of magnitude of the error and understanding how the error evolves over time.\n\n4. **Analyze Frequency Orbit:**\n   - Use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequency components of the system's response. FFT decomposes the time-domain signal into its frequency components, which is useful for identifying resonance frequencies and other dynamic characteristics of the system.\n\nWe used the SecondOrderODEProblem function from the DifferentialEquations.jl package to solve the mass-spring-damper system. This is the code implementation in Julia, following the suggestion from the example in section 8 : https://github.com/ziolai/software/blob/master/intro_ode.ipynb, but adapted to handle the damping case with a Dirac delta impulse.",
