Lahaye (DIAM - EEMCS Faculty - TU Delft)\n\n# Title: Mathematical modelling and numerical simulation of driving buses and vibrations door   \n\n1/ Introduction \n\n\n\nNumerical modeling to support/aid the design and construction of bus doors. Context of Ventura. See website. \n\n\n\n1.1/ Test Scenarios\n\n  \n\nImpact study: study of impact of object falling on elastic structure. Example sandbag test falling on door system (door leaves plus door support mechanism). \n\n\n\nForced vibration study: study of impact of forced vibration on elastic structure. Example door system mounted on shaker table or on bus driving over test track. \n\n\n\n2/ Definitions of Terms \n\n\n\nplug sliding door: \n\n\n\nbus door leaf:\n\n\n\nbus door suspension mechanism: \n\n\n\nupper door arm: \n\n\n\nbottom door support: \n\n\n3/ Single Point Mass System \n\n\n\n3.1 Case-study/Description/Motion\n\n\n\naggregate entire single door (door leaf + door frame) into single point mass. Information on the physics and the numerics gathered in this section is expected to be very beneficial in the remainder of the project. \n\n\n\n3.2/ Mathematical Model \n\n\n\nODE for mass-spring-damper + initial conditions for position and velocity (1-DOF along x-axis) \n\n\n\nm \\ddot{u}(t) + \\gamma \\dot{u}(t) + k u(t) = F_{external}(t)\n\n\n\nzero initial position and velocity \n\n\n\n3.3/ Parameter values \n\n\n\nm: between 50 and 100 kg \n\nk: such that \\sqrt{k/m} matches with measure resonant frequency \n\n\\gamma: hard to estimate - resort to \n\n\n\n3.4/ Impact study \n\n\n\ntest case description: impulsive force on mass-spring-damper (1-DOF along x-axis) system \n\n\n\nF_external: either a Dirac delta or a Gaussian pulse: perform FFT on Gaussian pulse to verify whether exitation contains a contribution in resonant frequency  \n\n\n\nanalytical solution in case of no damping (\\gamma = 0) assuming Dirac delta as excitation: Laplace transform: U(s) = constant/[ m s^2 + k]. Inverse Laplace transform. u(t) =  [ F_0/m sin(w_0 t) ] u(t=t_0). Physical interpretation: undamped harmonic oscillation at eigenfrequency (resonant frequency) of the system starting at the time of impact. Damped oscillation in case that \\gamma <> 0.  \n\n\n\nanalytical solution in case of damping (\\gamma <> 0): repeat above procedure. Obtain damped oscillation starting at the time of impact.\n\n\n\nnumerical study: numerical integration using DifferentialEquations.jl (implicit and explicit method, various absolute and relative tolerances, compare with the analytical solution, plot log10 of absolute value of the error). Analyze frequency orbit using Fast Fourier transform; \n\n\n\n3.5/ Vibration study \n\n\n\ntest case description: forced vibration of mass-spring-damper system at driving frequency \\omega_d. \n\n\n\nF_external: F_0 \\sin(\\omega_d t)\n\n\n\nanalytical solution: Laplace transform and its inverse. Superposition of two harmonic oscillations. First at eigenfrequency (resonant frequency) of the system. Second at driving frequency. Harmonic solution is damped oscillation in case that \\gamma <> 0. Only harmonic solution at driving frequency remains for large time (steady state). \n\n\n\nAnalytical solution: Laplace transform or method of undetermined coefficients. Study frequency response (\\omega_d < \\omega_0, \\omega_d = \\omega_0 and \\omega_d > \\omega_0)\n\n\n\nnumerical study:  as before; \n\n\n\n4/ Two Point Mass System \n\n\n\n4.1/ Case-study/Description/Motion: \n\n\n\nConsider model with two interconnected point masses (2-DOF along x-axis) (bus and door, two doors, door separated into two parts, door seperated into glass and metal frame). \n\n\n\n4.2/ Mathematical Model \n\n\n\nSystem of two coupled ODE \n\n\n\n4.3/ Impact study \n\n\nImpose impact on one of two point masses. Solve analytically using Laplace transform (find linear system for U_1(s) and U_2(s), solve linear system, perform backtransform to obtain u_1(t) and u_2(t)). Solve analytically using matrix diagonalization. Two resonant frequencies. Two vibrational eigenmodes (see comsol.com webpage). Solve numerically using time integration. Compare analytical and numerical solution. \n \n4.4/ Vibration study \n\n\nImpose forced vibration with driving frequency \\omega_d on one of two point masses. Proceed as before.  Investigate frequency response, in particular \\omega_d close to one of both resonant frequencies. \n\n\n\nReferences: \n\nhttps://github.com/ziolai/ventura-modeling/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/point-mass-systems.ipynb \n\n\n\n5/ Stationary Thin Beam Equation - Biharmonic Equation - Deflection \n\n\n\nFind analytical reference solution on wiki pages. Recover analytical reference using shooting method implemented in  DifferentialEquations.jl (see internship Yann Oukrid). \n\n\n\nSolve bi-harmonic equation using finite difference method on uniform spatial mesh. \n\n\n\n(In case that Anouchka finds this interesting and fun). Solve bi-harmonic equation using finite element method on non-uniform spatial mesh. \n\n\n\nReferences: \n\nimplementation in part available; \n\n\n\n6/ Thin Beam Equation Modal Analysis \n\n\n\nFind analytical expressions for the eigenmodes. Recover analytical expression by computing eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the discrete bi-harmonic equation. \n\n\n\nThe eigenvectors of the matrix A are numerical approximation to the shape modes or modal modes of the structure. These modes are explained on the wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_analysis_using_FEM . This webpage says that \"The physical interpretation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors which come from solving the system are that they represent the frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. Sometimes, the only desired modes are the lowest frequencies because they can be the most prominent modes at which the object will vibrate, dominating all the higher frequency modes.‚Äù\n\n\n\n7/ Thin Beam Equation Transient Analysis \n\n\n\nFind analytical reference solution (using e.g,. separation of variables) in literature. \n\n\n\nRecover analytical reference solution using finite difference in space and time-integration iin time domain. \n\n\n\n(In case that Anouchka finds this interesting and fun): replace uniform mesh finite differences in space by non-uniform mesh finite elements in space. \n\n\n\nReferences: \n\n\\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler\\%E2\\%80\\%93Bernoulli_beam_theory}\n\n\n\n8/ Thin Beam Equation Transient Analysis with Hinges as Boundary conditions \n\n\n\nFind reference solutions (see e.g. papers by Demeio - Lenci - 2019) (need to give Anouchka access to paper). \n\n\n\nReproduce reference results numerically using either finite differences on uniform mesh first and possibly using finite elements on non-uniform mesh later. \n\n\n\n9/ [In case time, enthousiasm and excitement remains] Extend to Two Dimensional Kirchoff - Love Thin Plate Equations \n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff\\%E2\\%80\\%93Love\\_plate\\_theory}\n\n\n\n10/ Conclusions \n\n\n\nWhat we learned in the project. \n",
