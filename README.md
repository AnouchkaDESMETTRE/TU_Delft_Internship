# TU Delft Internship: Modeling and Simulation of Bus Door Systems

## Project Overview

This repository contains the work carried out during my 3-month internship at **TU Delft**. The project focused on the **mechanical modeling** and **numerical simulation** of bus door systems, with the objective of improving structural behavior under various stress conditions. The simulations utilized advanced **partial differential equation (PDE)** solvers, such as the **biharmonic** and **diffusion** equations, to predict structural responses, optimize design, and enhance durability.

## Key Highlights

- **Numerical Methods:** The project implemented state-of-the-art numerical techniques for solving PDEs, specifically targeting complex door structures under dynamic loads.
  
- **Mass-Spring-Damper Systems:** The foundational models began with simple mass-spring systems and progressively incorporated more complex elements, leading to sophisticated simulations for real-world applications.

- **Biharmonic and Diffusion Equations:** Key focus on using biharmonic equations to model door deformations and diffusion equations for heat or stress distribution.

- **Sustainability Goals:** The project aligns with broader engineering goals of **sustainability** by enhancing material efficiency and reducing the overall weight of bus doors without compromising structural integrity.
