# TU Delft Internship: Modeling and Simulation of Bus Door Systems

## Project Overview

This repository documents the work conducted during my internship at **TU Delft** in collaboration with **Ventura**, a leading manufacturer of bus door systems. The project aimed to model and simulate the mechanical behavior of bus doors under various stress conditions to contribute to the development of more **sustainable** and **efficient public transportation systems**.

As cities shift towards **sustainable transportation**, improving the structural integrity and energy efficiency of bus components, such as doors, becomes a critical focus. Bus doors must withstand a range of stresses, including the impact of objects falling onto the door, while maintaining operational efficiency and safety standards. This project focused on understanding and optimizing these systems using advanced numerical methods.

## Key Highlights

- **Numerical Methods:** The project utilized numerical simulations to model door behavior under stress. The simulations solved **partial differential equations (PDEs)**, focusing on the **biharmonic** and **diffusion equations**, to predict structural responses and optimize design.
  
- **Mass-Spring-Damper Systems:** The initial models simulated simplified mass-spring systems and progressively expanded to account for the complex interactions between door components, leading to accurate predictions of door behavior under impact forces.

- **Sustainable Engineering:** In line with Ventura's goals of **lightweight** and **durable designs**, the simulations aimed to reduce the overall weight of the doors while maintaining **structural integrity** and **durability**.

- **Impact Simulation:** A critical part of the project involved simulating scenarios like an **object falling onto the door** and analyzing the structural response, essential for safety and durability in real-world urban environments.

## Conclusion

This project reflects the intersection of **engineering** and **sustainability**, where modern numerical tools are applied to solve real-world challenges. By working on the structural optimization of bus doors, we contribute to the broader effort of creating **more efficient** and **sustainable** urban transportation systems.
