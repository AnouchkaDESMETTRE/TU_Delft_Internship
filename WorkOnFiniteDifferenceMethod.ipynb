    "We begin our exploration by understanding the diffusion equation, starting in one dimension, where we apply finite differences and solve using basic linear algebra techniques. Progressing to two dimensions, we tackle $\\nabla^2 U = 0$, enhancing our approach with 2D grid discretization and comprehensive boundary condition implementations. This prepares us for the complex 2D biharmonic equation, $\\nabla^2(EI \\nabla^2 U) = S$, where higher order discretization methods and nested system solutions are utilized. Each step builds on the previous, gradually increasing our ability to handle more complex PDEs."
